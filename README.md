# E6156 - Topics in SW Engineering: (Mobile) Backend-as-a-Service

The focus of the this fall's 2020 section of Topics in Software Engineering continues to be cloud delivered 
applications and distributed systems. The unifying theme will be 
["(Mobile) Backend-as-a-Service"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_backend_as_a_service).

Several of the major cloud providers offer technology for backend as a service, e.g.
- [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
- [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/mobile/)

The course will use technology from the providers to understand and implement concepts. AWS will be the primary
platform, but the course will cover the other clouds.


## Topics


An initial/tentative list of topics will include:
1. Integration with productivity applications (G Suite, AWS WorkDocs).
2. Data synchronization and events (Firebase, AWS AppSync).
3. Security (starting with OAuth2).
4. Container-based applications and infrastructure, e.g. Kubernets on cloud IaaS.
5. Cloud databases, tentatively document, wide column and cloud databases.
6. Publish/Subscribe, event driven architecture using cloud services.
7. Service orchestration, workflow, service meshing.
8. Integration with social media.
9. Database/information integration, pipelines, etc.
10. Building multi-tenancy and SaaS applications.

## Course Format


The course format will be:
1. Weekly lecture covering the core topics.
2. Suggested reading and documents on details.
3. Weekly team meetings with the professor.


Students will work in small teams to develop a simple solution. The teams can choose their 
specific project and application as long as it covers the core topics. The instructor will 
help the students run their projects using very simple agile development and continuous integration. 
Final grade is based on the completeness and quality of the project.
